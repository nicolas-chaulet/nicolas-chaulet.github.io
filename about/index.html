Back then <a href=https://archpaper.com/2018/02/flux-to-shut-down/>Flux.io</a> was a high profile (ex Google-X) tech startup in the building and construction industry and I joined them a few days before <a href=helix.re>HELIX RE</a> was born. Our mission was to remove ubiquity in the built environment by creating accurate 3D models of all existing buidlings. We have achieved significant results in the 2 years that lasted my adventure with HELIX RE where I setup the office in London and lead our Applied Research activities in the field of point cloud processing and image processing.</p><p>Now time for new horizons!</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2020</span>
