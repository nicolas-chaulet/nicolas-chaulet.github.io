I am a climber and a technology leader with a passion for buildings. After graduating from my PhD in Applied Mathematics at Ecole Polytechnique in France, I moved to London to further my reserach in the field of medical imaging applied to stroke detection. The idea was great, using electrical currents for the diagnostic of strokes in ambulances, delivering proved to be extremely challenging. 

This experience led me to join Buro Happold engineering were I worked as tech lead on a range of software projects that aimed at bringing better data and insights into the design process. Back then [Flux.io](https://archpaper.com/2018/02/flux-to-shut-down/) was a high profile (ex Google-X) tech startup in the building and construction industry and I joined them a few days before [HELIX RE](helix.re) was born. Our mission was to remove ubiquity in the built environment by creating accurate 3D models of all existing buidlings. We have achieved significant results in the 2 years that lasted my adventure with HELIX RE where I setup the office in London and lead our Applied Research activities in the field of point cloud processing and image processing.

Now time for new horizons!
